Xcode 4 Code Snippets

Brennan Stehling - SmallSharpTools.com

--------------------------------------

I've created or collected the following code snippets to speed up
my work. My snippets focus on a few areas.

* animation
* blocks
* async (GCD and queues)
* notifications
* debugging
* formatting

I am open to feedback on improving this code or adding more code
snippets which would compliment them.
