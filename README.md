# Xcode 4 Code Snippets

--------------------------------------

I've created or collected the following code snippets to speed up my work. My snippets focus on a few areas.

* animation
* blocks
* async (GCD and queues)
* notifications
* debugging
* formatting

To use the snippets you will want to place them in the following folder.

'' ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/UserData/CodeSnippets

You may need to restart Xcode to see the change.

I am open to feedback on improving this code or adding more code snippets which would compliment them.
